# You can find a couple of OAuth 1.0a and 2.0 tests in the repository history
# (bazaar revision 100).
# These tests were removed because the signon-ui window where the webview is
# hosted will not be focused properly, both in Mir
# (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1231968) and Compiz
# (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/455241)
# This issue will be solved when we move the signon-ui implementation in the
# same process as online-accounts-ui
